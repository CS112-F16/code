2. When is an `import` statement required?
3. What will be the value stored in `result` after the following statement is executed: `double result = 2/5`?
4. Consider a variable of type `Scanner` as shown here: `Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in)`. What is the method you would call on `input` to read in an integer from the standard input stream?
5. Consider the following `if` statement:

```
if(x > 5) {
	System.out.println("x is large");
}
```
